ðŸ”¹ 1. Setup & Initialization
Task 1.1: Initialize the Project
âœ… What: Create folder structure as shown above
âœ… Why: Organizes client/server/shared logic
âœ… How: Use mkdir and create placeholder files

Task 1.2: Install Required Dependencies
âœ… What: Install Express and ws for WebSocket
âœ… Why: Used for HTTP server and real-time sync
âœ… How: npm init -y && npm install express ws

Task 1.3: Serve Static Files
âœ… What: Serve index.html and client JS via Express
âœ… Why: Allows the frontend to load on localhost
âœ… How: Express app.use(express.static('client'))

ðŸ”¹ 2. Game Map System
Task 2.1: Map Initialization
âœ… What: Generate 2D grid with:

indestructible walls

destructible blocks

free ground tiles
âœ… Why: Forms the game field
âœ… How: Use nested arrays with numeric tile values

Task 2.2: Spawn Zones
âœ… What: Ensure corners are clear for player spawning
âœ… Why: Players should not start stuck
âœ… How: Avoid placing blocks near (0,0), (mapWidth,mapHeight), etc.

Task 2.3: Map API
âœ… What: Write methods:

isWalkable(x, y)

destroyBlock(x, y)

placePowerUp(x, y)
âœ… Why: Used by movement, bomb and explosion logic
âœ… How: Use value checks inside the 2D grid

ðŸ”¹ 3. Player Logic
Task 3.1: Player Entity
âœ… What: Define properties:

ID

position

stats (bombs, range, speed)

lives
âœ… Why: Tracks each player's state
âœ… How: Use a class or object template

Task 3.2: Movement Logic
âœ… What: Check movement validity using Map.isWalkable()
âœ… Why: Prevents walking into walls
âœ… How: Validate next tile before updating position

Task 3.3: Player PowerUps
âœ… What: Collect power-ups when standing on one
âœ… Why: Updates stats (bomb count, range, speed)
âœ… How: Check map tile at player position on move

ðŸ”¹ 4. Bomb and Explosion Logic
Task 4.1: Bomb Entity
âœ… What: Create bombs with:

ownerId

position

timer (2s)
âœ… Why: Stores pending explosions
âœ… How: Add bombs to GameState, then explode on timeout

Task 4.2: Explosion Mechanics
âœ… What: When timer ends, explode in 4 directions
âœ… Why: Damages players, destroys blocks
âœ… How: Use for loops in all 4 directions, respect bomb range and walls

Task 4.3: Chain Reactions
âœ… What: If another bomb is in range, trigger it
âœ… Why: Supports classic Bomberman chain effect
âœ… How: Recursively call explosion for affected bombs

Task 4.4: Block Destruction
âœ… What: If explosion hits destructible block â†’ destroy it
âœ… Why: Opens new paths, reveals power-ups
âœ… How: Map.destroyBlock(x, y)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Power-Ups
Task 5.1: Power-Up Spawning
âœ… What: After a block is destroyed, chance to spawn power-up
âœ… Why: Adds game progression
âœ… How: Use random chance (e.g., 30%) after block destruction

Task 5.2: Power-Up Collection
âœ… What: Player collects power-up when stepping on it
âœ… Why: Buffs player stats
âœ… How: Check tile type and apply effect

ðŸ”¹ 6. Game State + Server Tick
Task 6.1: GameState Container
âœ… What: Create object to hold:

players

bombs

map

power-ups
âœ… Why: Single source of truth
âœ… How: Use a class or singleton module

Task 6.2: Game Loop (tick())
âœ… What: Run logic every 30ms
âœ… Why: Updates game consistently
âœ… How: Use setInterval or setTimeout

Task 6.3: Snapshot Sync
âœ… What: Every tick, send full snapshot to all clients
âœ… Why: Keeps game in sync across clients
âœ… How: Serialize GameState into plain object and emit via WebSocket

ðŸ”¹ 7. Frontend Game Client
Task 7.1: DOM Grid Renderer
âœ… What: Render 2D grid as HTML elements
âœ… Why: Visual representation of map
âœ… How: Use <div> elements in CSS grid

Task 7.2: Player/Bomb Rendering
âœ… What: Render player positions and bombs
âœ… Why: Visual feedback
âœ… How: Update classList or use data attributes for CSS styling

Task 7.3: DOM Optimization
âœ… What: Avoid full DOM re-renders
âœ… Why: Maintain 60FPS
âœ… How: Compare old vs new state and update only changes

Task 7.4: Input Handler
âœ… What: Capture arrow keys and spacebar
âœ… Why: Trigger movement and bombs
âœ… How: Add keydown listeners and emit actions to server

ðŸ”¹ 8. Chat System (Optional)
Task 8.1: Chat UI
âœ… What: Create input + chat log
âœ… Why: Simple communication
âœ… How: Basic DOM elements with scrollable div

Task 8.2: Chat Sync
âœ… What: Send chat messages via socket
âœ… Why: Sync across players
âœ… How: socket.emit('chat', msg), server broadcasts

ðŸ”¹ 9. Game Phases & Victory
Task 9.1: Game Phases
âœ… What: Phases: waiting, countdown, running, ended
âœ… Why: Organizes game flow
âœ… How: Track phase in GameState

Task 9.2: Countdown to Start
âœ… What: When 2+ players join, start countdown
âœ… Why: Wait for enough players
âœ… How: Use setTimeout to start game

Task 9.3: Victory Condition
âœ… What: Last player alive wins
âœ… Why: End the game fairly
âœ… How: Check if only 1 player has lives > 0

Task 9.4: Show Winner
âœ… What: Display winner screen on client
âœ… Why: Wraps up match
âœ… How: Server sends final snapshot with phase: "ended" and winner info
